        <h3 class="heading">Background</h3>
        <div class="row pad-bottom">
          <div class="col-sm-7">
            <p><a href="https://www.dexcom.com/" target="_blank">Dexcom</a>
              is a company that produces continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems to
              help those with diabetes track and manage their glucose levels.</p>
            <p>In Winter 2020, I had the opportunity to work with Dexcom and the UCSD Design Lab, taking part in the <a class="blue"
              href="http://ddi.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">Diabetes Design Initiative</a> (DDI).
              We met once a week for 4 hour work sessions. We were mentored by those at the head of the Design Lab
              and were occassionally joined by Dexcom employees.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-5">
            <img class="img-fluid center" src="images/dexcom-imgs/devices.png" style="width:80%;">
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>We worked in groups, with each team tackling a different aspect of users managing
          their blood glucose levels using Dexcom, such as in the setting of travelling or starting college.
          My team was in assigned the topic of <b>remote monitoring blood glucose levels in the setting of a children's diabetes camp.</b></p>
        <p>I worked alongside my team of 4 on researching, ideating, and designing solutions
              to improve the experience for camp counselors and parents who use the <a href="https://www.dexcom.com/dexcom-follow" target="-_blank">Dexcom Follow app</a>.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">What does the Follow app do?</h3>
        <p>The Dexcom Follow app connects people with diabetes to their loved ones. It allows their Followers to view and monitor their
          blood glucose levels, trends, and data. The most common users are parents and children, where the child is the CGM user and their parent is their Follower.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Problem</h3>
        <h2 class="text-center center dexcom-bold problem">How might we improve care coordination at camp?</h2>
        <p>At diabetes camps, camp counselors are also following the children and can see their CGM data. Since the counselors are the ones who are in close vicinity to the children while at camp,
          they are the ones who take care of the children when the app alerts them with a low or high glucose reading.</p>
        <p>However, parents who are monitoring their children at home will still receive the alerts from the Follow app. They <b>worry about if their children are being taken care of</b> and
          <b>if the camp counselors have addressed the alerts</b>.</p>
        <p>We wanted to explore the topic of <b>care coordination</b> and how we might reassure parents and other caretakers who are following their child that the counselors
          have given the proper treatment in accordance to the low and high readings.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">What are users saying about the Follow app?</h3>
        <p>We conducted interviews with volunteers from a San Diego based ADA diabetes camp,
          <a class="blue underline" href="http://main.diabetes.org/site/Calendar?view=Detail&id=54218"
          target="_blank">Camp Wana Kura</a>. This included camp counselors, medical staff, and a director
          of the camp. We also conducted secondary research through the Dexcom CGM Facebook Group and read
          reviews for Follow app.</p>
        <p class="dexcom-quote text-center"><em><b>"Kids were finally allowed to carry their own CGMs last year, but
          I feel like the camp isn't embracing technology. Parents also aren't 100% comfortable with not knowing
          what's going on behind the low and high alerts."</b></em></p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Key Insights</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Parents want <b>more context behind the numbers</b> they're seeing to reduce worry and concern that arises from
            the children being away during this time.</li>
          <li>Camp counselors and staff prefer a <b>one way communication system.</b></li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Opportunities</h3>
        <p>We created an activity map in the point of view of a camp counselor for a diabetes day camp
          supervising 15 children with CGMs. It breaks down how the counselor would currently track campers'
          glucose levels into 4 different stages.</p>
        <p>We identified 3 opportunities, highlighted in boxes on the activity map, that we could potentially implement.</p>
        <img class="img-fluid center pad-bottom" src="images/dexcom-imgs/activity-map.png" style="width:80%;">
        <p>After presenting our current research to Dexcom and consulting with them, we decided to focus on <b>improving
          the communication and collaboration between parents and camp counselors.</b></p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Our new feature implementation aims to...</h3>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h4 class="subtitle dexcom-bold">Support coordinated care</h4>
            <p>within the Dexcom ecosystem, easing worries & concerns from Followers not in close vicinity of the Sharer.</p>

            <h4 class="subtitle dexcom-bold">Encourage more people</h4>

        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Testing our iterative designs</h3>
        <p>After narrowing down our focus, we each created <b>sketches</b> to see how we could include our idea in
          the existing user interface on the Dexcom Follow app. We compiled all the best ideas into a single <b>paper prototype</b>
          and conducted user testing with participants with Type 1 diabetes or were familiar with CGMs.</p>
        <p>After we received feedback on the main features and the user flow of the app, we created <b>low-fidelity
          iteractive wireframes</b> using Figma. We conducted another round of user testing and received valuable feedback
          on more detailed aspects of the app.</p>
        <div class="row pad-bottom">
          <div class="col-sm-6">
            <h4 class="subtitle">User Testing over Zoom</h4>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="images/dexcom-imgs/zoom.png" style="width:60%;">
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-6">
            <h4 class="subtitle">Low to High-fidelity Prototyping in Figma</h4>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="images/dexcom-imgs/figma-ddi.png" style="width:90%;">
            <p><em>*Photos blurred for confidentiality</em></p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>We then worked on creating a <b>high-fidelity prototype</b> on Figma, incorporating all details and addressing the
          feedback we received. We kept iterating and refining our prototype after conducting further user testing.
          At the end of our 8 week design sprint, we worked on a pitch, a poster showing our important points, and presented to stakeholders
          at Dexcom, where we gained approval for our ideas and design.</p>
        <p class="dexcom-quote text-center"><em><b>"Would be very useful in the setting of a diabetes summer camp!"</b></em></p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Takeaways</h3>
        <p>Although I cannot disclose the final design for the user interface due to NDA,
          I am really happy with how it turned out and we received a positive response from Dexcom
          stakeholders at our final presentation. This was my first time working with industry;
          it was a really great experience and I've learned a lot! There was a lot of consulting
          with Dexcom and with our mentors at the Design Lab. It was really helpful to get their feedback at each
          stage so we could narrow down our broad topic of Remote Monitoring.</p>
        <p>I learned that just designing a new user interface wasn't enough. It's really important for us to be
          able to support our ideas with the research we've conducted and explain how our ideas
          would be useful. One thing I would do differently would be to practice version control and
          keep every iteration of our design, instead of accidentally overriding it with new changes.
          It's important to be able to see how the design has changed with every new iteration after each user test.</p>
