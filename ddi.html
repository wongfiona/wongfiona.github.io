            <p><a href="https://www.dexcom.com/" target="_blank">Dexcom</a>
              is a company that produces continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems to
              help those with diabetes track and manage their glucose levels.</p>
            <p>In Winter 2020, I had the opportunity to work with Dexcom and the UCSD Design Lab, taking part in the <a class="blue"
              href="http://ddi.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">Diabetes Design Initiative</a> (DDI).
              We met once a week for 4 hour work sessions. We were mentored by those at the head of the Design Lab
              and were occassionally joined by Dexcom employees.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-5">

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>We worked in groups, with each team tackling a different aspect of users managing
          their blood glucose levels using Dexcom, such as in the setting of traveling or starting college.
          My team was assigned the topic of <b class="dexcom-bold">remote monitoring blood glucose levels in the setting of a children's diabetes camp.</b></p>
        <p>I worked alongside my team of 4 on researching, ideating, and designing solutions
              to improve the experience for camp counselors and parents who use the <a href="https://www.dexcom.com/dexcom-follow" target="-_blank">Dexcom Follow app</a>.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß What does the Follow app do?</h3>
        <p>The Dexcom Follow app connects people with diabetes to their loved ones. It allows their Followers to <b class="dexcom-bold">view and monitor their
          blood glucose levels, trends, and data</b>. The most common users are parents and children, where the child is the CGM user and their parent is their Follower.</p>
      </div>

        <h3 class="heading">‚ùì Problem</h3>
        <h2 class="text-center center dexcom-bold problem" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="300" data-aos-easing="ease-in-out" data-aos-anchor-placement="center-bottom" data-aos-once="true">
          How might we improve care coordination at camp?</h2>
        <p>At diabetes camps, camp counselors are also following the children and can see their CGM data. Since the counselors are the ones who are in close vicinity to the children while at camp,
          they are the ones who take care of the children when the app alerts them with a low or high glucose reading.</p>
        <p>However, parents who are monitoring their children at home will still receive the alerts from the Follow app. They <b class="dexcom-bold">worry about if their children are being taken care of</b> and
          if the camp counselors have addressed the alerts.
          We wanted to explore the topic of care coordination and how we might <b class="dexcom-bold">reassure parents and other caretakers</b> who are following their child that the counselors
          have given the proper treatment in accordance to the low and high readings.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-7">
            <p>We conducted interviews with volunteers from a San Diego based ADA diabetes camp,

              target="_blank">Camp Wana Kura</a>. This included camp counselors, medical staff, and a director
              of the camp. We also conducted secondary research through the Dexcom CGM Facebook Group and read
              reviews for Follow app.</p>
            <!--<p class="dexcom-quote text-center"><em><b>"Kids were finally allowed to carry their own CGMs last year, but
              I feel like the camp isn't embracing technology. Parents also aren't 100% comfortable with not knowing
              what's going on behind the low and high alerts."</b></em></p>-->

        <p>We created an activity map in the point of view of a camp counselor at a diabetes day camp
          supervising 15 children with CGMs. It breaks down <b class="dexcom-bold">how the counselor would currently track campers'
          glucose levels</b> into 4 different stages. We ideated and identified 3 different opportunities we could potentially implement

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">üí° Ideating & Testing</h3>
        <p>After narrowing down our focus, we each created sketches to see how we could include our idea in
          the existing user interface on the Dexcom Follow app. We compiled all the best ideas into a single <b class="dexcom-bold">paper prototype
          and conducted usability testing</b> with participants with Type 1 diabetes or were familiar with CGMs.</p>
        <p>After we received feedback on the concept and the user flow of the app, we created <b class="dexcom-bold">interactive low-fidelity
          wireframes</b> using Figma. We conducted another round of user testing and received valuable feedback
          on more detailed aspects of the app, such as the layout and placement of elements.</p>
        <div class="row pad-bottom">
          <div class="col-sm-6" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="300" data-aos-easing="ease-in-out" data-aos-anchor-placement="center-bottom" data-aos-once="true">

          <div class="col-sm-6" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="300" data-aos-easing="ease-in-out" data-aos-anchor-placement="center-bottom" data-aos-delay="400" data-aos-once="true">
            <h4 class="subtitle">Low to High-fidelity Prototyping in Figma</h4>

            <p><em>*Photos blurred for confidentiality</em></p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>We then worked on creating a <b class="dexcom-bold">high-fidelity prototype</b> on Figma, incorporating all details and addressing the
          feedback we received. We kept iterating and refining our prototype after conducting further user testing.
          At the end of our 8 week design sprint, we worked on a pitch, a poster showing our important points, and presented to stakeholders
          at Dexcom, where we gained approval for our ideas and design.</p>
        <p class="dexcom-quote text-center"><em><b>"This would be very useful in the setting of a diabetes summer camp!"</b></em> - Camp Counselor, Registered Nurse & Certified Diabetes Educator</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">üí≠ Takeaways</h3>
        <p>Although I cannot disclose the final design for the user interface due to NDA,
          I am really happy with how it turned out and we received a positive response from Dexcom
          stakeholders at our final presentation. This was my first time working with industry
          and it was a really great experience! I've learned a lot, such as: <!--There was a lot of consulting
          with Dexcom and with our mentors at the Design Lab. It was really helpful to get their feedback at each
          stage so we could narrow down our broad topic of Remote Monitoring.--></p>
        <ol>
          <li><b class="dexcom-bold">Just designing a new user interface isn't enough.</b>
            <p>It's really important to be able to support our ideas with the user research we've conducted and explain our rationale for our design decisions.
              I learned how to communicate our findings and design thinking to Dexcom stakeholders and practiced my storytelling skills.</p>
          </li>
          <li><b class="dexcom-bold">Practice version control and keep every design iteration.</b>
            <p>This was one thing I would do differently next time, instead of accidentally overriding our designs with new changes.
              It's important to be able to see how the design has changed with every new iteration after each user test.</p>
          </li>
