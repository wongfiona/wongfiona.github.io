            is a company that produces continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems to
            help those with diabetes track and manage their glucose levels.</p>
          <p>This summer, I had the opportunity to work with Dexcom again, after previously working with them and the UCSD Design Lab in Winter 2020. I participated in the <a
            href="http://ddi.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">Diabetes Design Initiative</a> (DDI) once again,
            but this time it was fully remote due to COVID-19.</p>
          <p>For 10 weeks, I worked in a team of 4 on researching, ideating, and designing solutions
            to enhance the experience for people who use the <a href="https://www.dexcom.com/dexcom-follow" target="-_blank">Dexcom Follow app</a>.</p>

        <h3 class="heading">👨‍👩‍👧 What does the Follow app do?</h3>
        <p>The Dexcom Follow app connects people with diabetes to their loved ones. It allows their Followers to <b class="dexcom-bold">view and monitor their
          blood glucose levels, trends, and data</b>. The most common users are parents and children, where the child is the CGM user and their parent is their Follower.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">❓ Problem</h3>
        <p>Many parents use the Follow app as their primary way to see real-time readings about their children's blood glucose levels.
          It can be frustrating when the app doesn't provide them with everything they need, especially when treating an urgent low alert.</p>
        <h2 class="text-center center dexcom-bold problem" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="300" data-aos-easing="ease-in-out" data-aos-anchor-placement="center-bottom" data-aos-once="true">
          How might we implement or update features in Follow to address a wide spectrum of user needs?</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">🤔 What are users saying about the Follow app?</h3>
        <p>We conducted extensive secondary research to provide context on the problem and understand user pain points.
          We examined the <b class="dexcom-bold">top 50 app reviews</b> on both the App Store and Google Play Store, and sorted them by user sentiment.
          We then categorized the reviews based off of pain points and saw what issues were the most common among users.</p>

            <h3 class="heading">🗣 Users echoed their pain points on social media</h3>
            <p>Besides app reviews, we also looked on social media platforms, such as Facebook and Reddit, to collect feedback about
                what users were saying about the Follow app.</p>
            <p>We found that they <b class="dexcom-bold">shared similar sentiments and pain points</b>
                with those who had written app reviews. These findings allowed us to create proto-personas of our target audience
                and helped us formulate our interview questions.</p>
            <h4 class="subheading">Most common user pain points</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Lack of alert customization with sounds and setting repeating alerts</li>
              <li>Limited to only 24 hours of data when phone is turned horizontally</li>

        <h3 class="heading">🔍 Competitors allowed greater customization of alerts</h3>
        <p>We performed a competitive analysis with CGM monitoring apps similar to Follow to see what their competitors were doing
          and look at potential areas of improvement. The main difference between the Dexcom Follow app and their competitors was in <b class="dexcom-bold">the level of customization
          for alerts.</b></p>

        <h3 class="heading">💬 Speaking directly to Follow App users</h3>
        <p>As a team, we conducted <b class="dexcom-bold">20 user interviews remotely on Zoom</b> with parents and caretakers who monitor their children using the Follow app.
          We wanted to hear about their experiences so far using Follow, understand their pain points, and see what features they would want implemented to the app.</p>
        <p>We compiled all the interview notes and responses on a spreadsheet and on our Miro board for affinity mapping to categorize the different problems
          and opportunities we could design for.</p>

        <ul class="pad-bottom">

      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">💡 Ideating & Testing</h3>
        <p>We had an ideation session with our Dexcom mentors and each team member did Crazy 8's to explore different ideas that our
          redesigned Follow app could implement. We voted on the best ideas and worked together to combine them in a working prototype in Figma.</p>
        <p>We conducted <b class="dexcom-bold">7 usability tests</b> and walked each participant through our testing session over Zoom. We had them complete typical tasks on the app
          and observed how they responded to our new proposed features.</p>
        <p>After each user test, we <b class="dexcom-bold">constantly ideated and iterated</b> based off their feedback, so each user saw a new and improved
          version of the prototype each time. Their input was extremely valuable and helped us decide the best way to represent
          our ideas on the screens.</p>

        <h3 class="heading pad-bottom">💭 Takeaways</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><b class="dexcom-bold">Learned how to prioritize features that were most important to users.</b>
            <p>We conducted a lot of user research and interviews and came up with a prototype that combined a lot of features that several users wanted. But because there were so many new features we could explore,
              I learned how to prioritize the ones that were the <em>most</em> important to users, based on our research and user pain points.</p>
          </li>
          <li><b class="dexcom-bold">It's important to be open to feedback.</b>
            <p>Being receptive to design feedback & critiques is crucial in order to improve on design iterations, making sure to take user feedback into account.</p>
          </li>
          <li><b class="dexcom-bold">Learned how to effectively communicate my design thinking to stakeholders</b>
            <p>Showing the intentionality behind our designs, like why we designed something, is important. We did this by presenting clear research findings and supporting it with stats from our user interviews and usability tests
              to show how important our users’ feedback was and how that impacted our designs.</p>
          </li>
          <!--<li><b class="dexcom-bold">Utilize online tools to help communicate across the distance.</b>
            <p>It was challenging to work on a team project remotely, but utilizing online tools, such as Zoom, Slack, Figma, and Miro helped us work together efficiently.
              We also faced the challenge of conducting user interviews and usability tests remotely over Zoom instead of in person, but we worked around this by creating
              a detailed interview guide and testing protocol, with specific instructions such as how to share your screen.</p>
          </li>-->
        </ol>
        <!--<p>This was my second time working with Dexcom and the UCSD Design Lab and even though it was remote, I enjoyed it a lot!
          It was challenging to work on a team project remotely, but <b class="dexcom-bold">utilizing online tools</b> such as Zoom, Slack, Figma, and Miro helped us communicate across
          the distance and allowed us to work together. We also faced the challenge of conducting user interviews and usability tests remotely over Zoom
          video chats instead of in person, but we worked around this by creating a detailed interview guide and testing protocol, with specific instructions
          such as how to share your screen.</p>
        <p>Throughout this summer internship, I gained more experience conducting user interviews and usability tests,
          as well as <b class="dexcom-bold">communicating my design thinking to stakeholders</b>. One thing I would have done differently would be to build a closer relationship
          to our mentors beyond the weekly team meetings.</p>-->
