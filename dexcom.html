          <p><em><b>Disclaimer:</b> My work is currently under NDA, so I cannot reveal the
            final design or go through my project in full detail. However, if you are interested in learning more about this project, please

          <p>In Winter 2020, I had the opportunity to work with <a class="blue underline"
            href="https://www.dexcom.com/" target="_blank">Dexcom</a>, a company
            that develops products to help people manage diabetes. I joined the UCSD
            Design Lab as a part-time UX designer & researcher, taking part in their <a class="blue underline"
            href="http://ddi.ucsd.edu/transitions.html" target="_blank">Diabetes
            Design Initiative (DDI)</a> on an intense 8 week design sprint. We met once a week
            for 4 hour work sessions. We were mentored by those at the head of the Design Lab
            and were occassionally joined by Dexcom employees.</p>
          <p>We worked in groups, with each team tackling a different aspect of users managing
            their blood glucose levels using Dexcom's continuous glucose system (CGM), such as
            in the setting of travelling or starting college. My team was in charge of
            remote monitoring blood glucose levels in the setting of a children's diabetes camp.</p>

      <div class="row-text">
        <div class="col-sm-4 column-text">
          <h3 class="heading">User Research</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-8 column-text pad-right">
          <p>We conducted interviews with volunteers from a San Diego based ADA diabetes camp,
            <a class="blue underline" href="http://main.diabetes.org/site/Calendar?view=Detail&id=54218"
            target="_blank">Camp Wana Kura</a>. This included camp counselors, medical staff, and a director
            of the camp. We also conducted secondary research through the Dexcom CGM Facebook Group and read
            reviews for Dexcom Follow, an app that allows patients to share their blood glucose data with
            their family, friends, and caretakers. </p>
          <h4 class="subtitle">Insights</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Parents want more context behind the numbers they're seeing to reduce worry and concern that arises from
              the children being away during this time.</li>
            <li>Camp counselors and staff prefer a one way communication system.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4 class="subtitle">Opportunities</h4>
          <p>We created an activity map in the point of view of a camp counselor for a diabetes day camp
            supervising 15 children with CGMs. It breaks down how the counselor would currently track campers'
            glucose levels into 4 different stages.</p>
          <p>We identified 3 opportunities, highlighted in boxes on the activity map, that we could potentially implement.</p>
          <img class="img-fluid center" src="images/dexcom-imgs/activity-map.png" style="width:100%;">
          <p>After presenting our current research to Dexcom and consulting with them, we decided to focus on improving
            the communication and collaboration between parents and camp counselors.</p>
          <h4 class="subtitle">Goals</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Break down barriers to CGM use in diabetes camps</li>
            <li>Encourage more people to use the Dexcom Follow app</li>
            <li>Support coordinated care within the Dexcom ecosystem</li>
          </ul>

      <div class="row-text">
        <div class="col-sm-4 column-text">
          <h3 class="heading">Iterative Prototyping & User Testing</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-8 column-text pad-right">
          <p>After narrowing down our focus, we each created <b>sketches</b> to see how we could include our idea in
            the existing user interface on the Dexcom Follow app. We compiled all the best ideas into a single <b>paper prototype</b>
            and conducted user testing with participants with Type 1 diabetes or were familiar with CGMs.</p>
          <p>After we received feedback on the main features and the user flow of the app, we created <b>low-fidelity
            iteractive wireframes</b> using Figma. We conducted another round of user testing and received valuable feedback
            on more detailed aspects of the app.</p>
          <p>Next, we worked on creating a <b>high-fidelity prototype</b> on Figma, incorporating all details and addressing the
            feedback we received. We kept iterating and refining our prototype after conducting further user testing.
            At the end of our design sprint, we worked on a pitch, a poster showing our important points, and presented to stakeholders at Dexcom.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-4 column-text">
          <h3 class="heading">Takeaways</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-8 column-text pad-right">
          <p>Although I cannot disclose the final design for the user interface due to NDA,
            I am really happy with how it turned out and we received a positive response from Dexcom
            stakeholders at our final presentation. This was my first time working with industry;
            it was a really great experience and I've learned a lot! There was a lot of consulting
            with Dexcom and with our mentors at the Design Lab. It was really helpful to get their feedback at each
            stage so we could narrow down our broad topic of Remote Monitoring. I learned that
            just designing a new user interface wasn't enough. It's really important for us to be
            able to support our ideas with the research we've conducted and explain how our ideas
            would be useful.</p>
          <h4 class="subtitle">Next Steps</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Conduct more user testing with camp counselors and parents</li>
            <li>Simulate use in real world scenarios</li>
          </ul>
