            is a company that produces continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems to
            help those with diabetes track and manage their glucose levels.</p>
          <p>This summer, I had the opportunity to work with Dexcom again, after previously working with them and the UCSD Design Lab in Winter 2020. I participated in the <a
            href="http://ddi.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">Diabetes Design Initiative</a> (DDI) once again,
            but this time, it was fully remote due to COVID-19.</p>
          <p>For 10 weeks, I worked in a team of 4 on researching, ideating, and designing solutions
            to enhance the experience for people who use the <a href="https://www.dexcom.com/dexcom-follow" target="-_blank">Dexcom Follow app</a>.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">What does the Follow app do?</h3>
        <p>The Dexcom Follow app connects people with diabetes to their loved ones. It allows their Followers to <b class="dexcom-bold">view and monitor their
          blood glucose levels, trends, and data</b>. The most common users are parents and children, where the child is the CGM user and their parent is their Follower.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Problem</h3>
        <p>Many parents use the Follow app as their primary way to see real-time readings about their children's blood glucose levels.
          It can be frustrating when the app doesn't provide them with everything they need, especially when treating an urgent low alert.</p>
        <h2 class="text-center center dexcom-bold problem">How might we implement or update features in Follow to address a wide spectrum of user needs?</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">What are users saying about the Follow app?</h3>
        <p>We conducted extensive secondary research to provide context on the problem and understand user pain points.
          We examined the <b class="dexcom-bold">top 50 app reviews</b> on both the App Store and Google Play Store, and sorted them by user sentiment.
          We then categorized the reviews based off of pain points and saw what issues were the most common among users.</p>
        <img class="img-fluid center pad-bottom" src="images/dexcom-imgs/app-reviews.png" style="width:70%;">
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <div class="row pad-bottom">
          <div class="col-sm-9">
            <h3 class="heading">Users echoed their pain points on social media</h3>
            <p>Besides app reviews, we also looked on <b class="dexcom-bold">social media platforms</b>, such as Facebook and Reddit, to collect feedback about
                what users were saying about the Follow app. We found that they shared similar sentiments and pain points
                with those who had written app reviews. These findings allowed us to create proto-personas of our target audience
                and helped us formulate our interview questions.</p>
            <h4 class="subheading">Most common user pain points</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Lack of alert customization with sounds and setting repeating alerts</li>
              <li>Limited to only 24 hours of data when phone is turned horizontally</li>
              <li>Graph doesn't have enough detail</li>

      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Competitors allowed greater customization of alerts</h3>
        <p>We performed a competitive analysis with CGM monitoring apps similar to Follow to see what their competitors were doing
          and look at potential areas of improvement. The main difference between the Dexcom Follow app and their competitors was in <b class="dexcom-bold">the level of customization
          for alerts.</b></p>
        <img class="img-fluid center pad-bottom" src="images/dexcom-imgs/competitors.png" style="width:100%;">
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Speaking directly to Follow App users</h3>
        <p>As a team, we conducted <b class="dexcom-bold">20 user interviews remotely on Zoom</b> with parents and caretakers who monitor their children using the Follow app.
          We wanted to hear about their experiences so far using Follow, understand their pain points, and see what features they would want implemented to the app.
          We compiled all the interview notes and responses on a spreadsheet and on our Miro board for affinity mapping to categorize the different problems
          and opportunities we could design for.</p>

        <h3 class="heading">Key Findings During User Research</h3>
        <p>Our findings from our user interviews also supported the pain points we found in our secondary research, validating
          what we had found initially.</p>
        <ul class="pad-bottom">
          <li>17 users want more <b>statistical data</b> (longer time frame for graph, patterns & trends)</li>
          <li>16 users want more <b>customization with alerts</b> (more sound variety & customize repeat alerts)</li>
          <li>5 users want to see <b>food intake & insulin dosage logs</b></li>
        </ul>
      </div>-->

      <!--<div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Opportunities</h3>
        <p>After synthesizing our user research and interview findings, we came up with 3 main opportunities to focus on:</p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h4 class="subtitle dexcom-bold">Greater alert customization</h4>
            <p>to allow users to set when and how they want to receive alerts.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h4 class="subtitle dexcom-bold">More data accessibility</h4>
            <p>to allow users to view more detailed data, trends & statistics.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h4 class="subtitle dexcom-bold">Addition of event logs</h4>
            <p>to provide users with more context behind the glucose readings.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>-->

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Testing our iterative designs</h3>
        <p>We had an ideation session with our Dexcom mentors and each team member did Crazy 8's to explore different ideas that our
          redesigned Follow app could implement. We voted on the best ideas and worked together to combine them in a working prototype in Figma.</p>
        <p>We conducted <b class="dexcom-bold">7 usability tests</b> and walked each participant through our testing session over Zoom. We had them complete typical tasks on the app
          and observed how they responded to our new proposed features.</p>
        <p>After each user test, we <b class="dexcom-bold">constantly ideated and iterated</b> based off their feedback, so each user saw a new and improved
          version of the prototype each time. Their input was extremely valuable and helped us decide the best way to represent
          our ideas on the screens.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading pad-bottom">What I Did Throughout the Internship</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="pad-bottom"><b>Conducted user interviews and usability tests</b> with Follow app users, organizing findings & insights on Miro</li>
          <li class="pad-bottom"><b>Continuously ideated, prototyped, and tested</b> several designs with Follow app users to produce a solution that
            met both user and stakeholder needs</li>
          <li class="pad-bottom"><b>Planned and held weekly meetings with DDI and Dexcom mentors</b>, getting feedback at each stage and ensuring our team was on the right track</li>
          <li class="pad-bottom"><b>Created the interim and final deliverable presentation slide decks</b> to update our progress and next steps to Dexcom stakeholders </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Takeaways</h3>
        <p>This was my second time working with Dexcom and the UCSD Design Lab and even though it was remote, I enjoyed it a lot!
          It was challenging to work on a team project remotely, but <b class="dexcom-bold">utilizing online tools</b> such as Zoom, Slack, Figma, and Miro helped us communicate across
          the distance and allowed us to work together. We also faced the challenge of conducting user interviews and usability tests remotely over Zoom
          video chats instead of in person, but we worked around this by creating a detailed interview guide and testing protocol, with specific instructions
          such as how to share your screen.</p>
        <p>Throughout this summer internship, I gained more experience conducting user interviews and usability tests,
          as well as <b class="dexcom-bold">communicating my design thinking to stakeholders</b>. One thing I would have done differently would be to build a closer relationship
          to our mentors beyond the weekly team meetings.</p>
