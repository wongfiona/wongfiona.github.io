        <p>The Dexcom Follow app connects people with diabetes to their loved ones. It allows their Followers to <b class="dexcom-bold">view and monitor their
          blood glucose levels, trends, and data</b>. The most common users are parents and children, where the child is the CGM user and their parent is their Follower.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">‚ùì Problem</h3>
        <p>Many parents use the Follow app as their primary way to see real-time readings about their children's blood glucose levels.
          It can be frustrating when the app doesn't provide them with everything they need, especially when treating an urgent low alert.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">ü§î What are users saying about the Follow app?</h3>
        <p>We conducted extensive secondary research to provide context on the problem and understand user pain points.
          We examined <b class="dexcom-bold">50 most recent app reviews</b> on both the App Store and Google Play Store, and sorted them by user sentiment.
          We found that <b class="dexcom-bold">94% of reviews were negative</b>.
          We then categorized the reviews based off of pain points and saw what issues were the most common among users.</p>

            <p>Besides app reviews, we also looked on social media platforms, such as Facebook and Reddit, to collect feedback about
                what users were saying about the Follow app.</p>
            <p>We found that they <b class="dexcom-bold">shared similar sentiments and pain points</b>
                with those who had written app reviews. These findings allowed us to create proto-personas of our target audience

        <p>Keeping those design principles in mind, we started ideating. Each team member did Crazy 8's to explore different ideas that our redesigned Follow app could implement.
          We did dot voting to narrow down the ideas we liked best and worked together to combine them in a working prototype in Figma.</p>

            <p>We conducted a lot of user research and interviews and came up with a prototype that combined a lot of features that several users wanted. But because there were so many new features we could explore,
              I learned how to prioritize the ones that were the <em>most</em> important to users, based on our research and user pain points.</p>
          </li>
          <li><b class="dexcom-bold">It's important to be open to feedback.</b>
            <p>Being receptive to design feedback & critiques is crucial in order to improve on design iterations, making sure to take user feedback into account.</p>
          </li>
          <li><b class="dexcom-bold">Learned how to effectively communicate my design thinking to stakeholders</b>
            <p>Showing the intentionality behind our designs, like why we designed something, is important. We did this by presenting clear research findings and supporting it with stats from our user interviews and usability tests
              to show how important our users‚Äô feedback was and how that impacted our designs.</p>

            <p>It was challenging to work on a team project remotely, but utilizing online tools, such as Zoom, Slack, Figma, and Miro helped us work together efficiently.
              We also faced the challenge of conducting user interviews and usability tests remotely over Zoom instead of in person, but we worked around this by creating
              a detailed interview guide and testing protocol, with specific instructions such as how to share your screen.</p>

          the distance and allowed us to work together. We also faced the challenge of conducting user interviews and usability tests remotely over Zoom

        <p>Throughout this summer internship, I gained more experience conducting user interviews and usability tests,
          as well as <b class="dexcom-bold">communicating my design thinking to stakeholders</b>. One thing I would have done differently would be to build a closer relationship
          to our mentors beyond the weekly team meetings.</p>-->
