             UC San Diego campus and published to the public via the Apple App Store
             and Google Play as of March 2018. It promotes 8 specific features

          <h4>Core Problems</h4>
          <p>The users helped us to identify the core problems of the UCSD App’s
            Dining Sections during their interviews and tasks. Their favored method
            of choice of letting us know these was by verbally complaining about the
            app itself. We went in further through tasks and a few more “why’s” to
            pinpoint their exact grievances felt when navigating the the Dining Section.</p>
          <h5 class="blue subtitle">Hard to Navigate</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><b>No search bar:</b> A lot of work, tedious to scroll endlessly to look
              for what someone wants</li>
              <li><b>No filtering:</b> Cannot filter the search</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>“There was no way to see the distinctions between dining halls and PC
              restaurants at a quick glance, so I felt frustrated that there wasn't a
              simple search tool” (User 15).</em></p>
            <p>Users most notably voiced their frustrations over the lack of a search bar,
              finding it tedious to scroll endlessly until they came across their
              desired restaurant or detail. With the lack of filtering, they often
              found themselves scrolling past the specific restaurants we had asked
              them to find during the tasks. We witnessed users like User 15, who scrolled
              through the Jamba Juice section a total of 5 separate times before finding
              it during Task 5, voice their <b>frustration</b> at an apparent lack of ordering.</p>
          <h5 class="blue subtitle">Disorganized</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Unordered:</b> No apparent order, information is scattered (e.g. not
                ordered alphabetically or by distance)</li>
              <li><b>Not categorized:</b> No visual difference between dining hall, market
                restaurant, coffee place or something else</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>“So disorganized. Doesn't make me want to use this app because it's
              hard to use. I hate that I have to keep scrolling, there's no search bar,
              nothing to filter what I'm looking for” (User 4). “It is pretty useless.
              There is no filtering, it needs search bar. . . disorganized!” (User 5).</em></p>
            <p>We heard this word come up again and again: <em><b>disorganized</b></em>. With the Dining Section
              being ranked in no apparent order, information felt scattered to the users.
              There was no integration of order either alphabetically, categorically, or
              location-based distances. This created a loss of dependability within the
              user’s perceptions of the app; this was not a resourceful tool they would
              routinely use when expecting fast solutions to their needs. The <b>lack of
              categorization</b> was visually implicit; there was no apparent difference
              between a dining hall, market, restaurant, cafe or anything else.</p>
          <h5 class="blue subtitle">Lack of Differentiation</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><b>No comparison</b> on the prices: Impossible to determine what's cheap
                and what's expensive</li>
              <li><b>Users unsure</b> of what type of food is served at each establishment</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>“. . .it's a long list and there is no order, should have separate
              dining halls and restaurants” (User 18)</em></p>
            <p>There is no visible comparison between establishments on the Dining
              Section start menu. This was exemplified in Task 8, where users had
              difficulty determining the difference between cheap and expensive places
              to get meals on-campus. Users were also unsure of what type of food was
              served at each of these places. When prompted to tell us the most expensive
              and the cheapest place on campus, User 15 went as far as to admit defeat
              from the app saying, <em>“I have no idea how to do this. They don’t even
              have an expenses indicator, I give up.”</em></p>
            <p>This kind of learned helplessness was almost inevitable from a design
              point of view. User 16 voiced this exact problem by saying, <em>“How do
              I do that? I would have to go through every single one.. There’s no way
              to quickly tell..unless I go through every single menu item and look at prices.”</em></p>
            <img class="center img-fluid dining-img" src="images/dining-imgs/problems.png" style="width: 700px">
            <p>Although the UC San Diego mobile app does afford users the ability to search through
              the application to answer all their questions, it is not the most realistic or
              efficient way of providing information preoccupied students or faculty. The app had
              become more of an inconvenience than a daily tool to be utilized.</p>
            <h4 class="subtitle">Trends</h4>
            <img class="center img-fluid dining-img" src="images/dining-imgs/feedback.png" style="width: 700px">
            <p>Overall, the original UC San Diego Mobile App: Dining Section was not a user-friendly
              interface. These problems originated with the interface of the app itself, with large
              bodies of text and a minimal use of visual aids or sectioning to break up the monotony
              of presentation. This was exemplified in its disorganization and lack of categorization;
              users felt constantly overwhelmed by information and dissatisfied with the use of time
              navigating the app for certain details took. The app’s end product: a confusing process
              and design needed to be streamlined into a smoother look and general experience.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-8 column-text">
          <p>Following the double diamond design, we analyzed the problem and redesigned
            the interface. For the solution, we brainstormed our ideas and sketched as
            many prototypes we could come up with. Since we all had different ideas,
            each of us drew the prototype we had in mind, and then combined our idea
            into the best version. The sketches helped us come to an agreement on the redesign.</p>

          <img class="img-fluid prototype-img" src="images/dining-imgs/prototypes.png" style="width: 410px">
        <p>The picture above includes more wireframes we sketched. There is a map to indicate
          where the closest dining halls and restaurants are. Five blocks are on top to separate
          “all”, “dining hall”, “restaurant”, “cafe”, and “other” categories. Clicking on any
          of those sections would list down the specific food places which correspond to the
          clicked section. Because there would be a list of restaurants for each category, there
          was no need to have a list of restaurants under the map in the main page. On top of those
          blocks there is also the search bar, used to search for restaurants. We also thought about
          adding pictures on the list of dining hall / restaurants, rather than just having the name of the place.
          We thought that having several images with keywords of food offered by the food place would be
          more helpful and visually appealing.</p>

          <p>We created our final redesign using Marvel, a collaborative design platform
            that allows designers to create digital mockups of mobile applications.
            Using Marvel, we were also able to connect the workflow of the app and
            make it an interactive prototype. </p>

          <p>This table shows a comparison of our redesign with other existing designs
            (1: bad ; 5: good). We chose these factors to compare because, according to our
            user feedback, these were the factors that were necessary in our redesign.</p>
          <p>The <b>current UCSD dining section</b> is not very informative. It just has a lot of
            textual information. It has a complicated layout with no organization or
            visual aesthetics, making it really hard to use.</p>
          <img class="center img-fluid dining-img" src="images/dining-imgs/original.png" style="width:750px">
          <p>The <b>HDH website</b> is very informative. It provides information about every dining hall,
            with specific information on vegan, vegetarian, or gluten-free food. However, due to
            its layout, it feels like a lot of information is put together in one place, and thus
            it is somewhat disorganized. On top of that there are no images of the food either. It
            is not hard to navigate through the website, but going through the website every single
            time they want food is not the best way for busy students and faculty to find out what
            kind of food is being served at dining halls and restaurants.</p>
          <img class="center img-fluid dining-img" src="images/dining-imgs/hdh.png" style="width:700px">
          <p>The <b>Tapingo</b> application, like the UCSD dining section, does not provided any specific
            order or ability to filter the the list of establishments; however it is still ranked
            higher in than the UCSD dining app or the HDH website because it provided the user to
            search for the establishment that they were looking for. In addition, this application
            allows for users to see a complete list of all the food that is offered and its prices
            so that they could order.</p>
          <p><b>Yelp</b> has a great layout, visual aesthetics, and is very informative. However the users
            that we target are UCSD students who need to use dining dollars or find places to eat on
            campus. Yelp goes beyond that and provides with more than necessary information, thus
            confusing the user and not providing the need. </p>
          <img class="center img-fluid dining-img" src="images/dining-imgs/tapingo.png" style="width:500px">
          <p>Our redesign focuses on all those factors. We added images that can expand (so that
            the foods are more appealing), filter/sorting tools so that it is easier to find the
            food the user wants, and have a good balance between images and textual information.
            Overall all these factors make it much easier to navigate through the new UCSD app
            than the current one.</p>

          <p>After working on this project, I've learned that the balance between information
            and visual aids is extremely important to build an effective interface. For our application,
            there was a lot of information offered, so having organization and filter options are very
            useful for efficient navigation. It is also imperative that designers test their prototypes
            before publishing it as their final design, because user testing provides valuable feedback and
            shows any points where they are confused with the design.</p>
          <h4 class="subtitle">Next Steps</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Add a "Favorites" feature, so users can heart their favorite places</li>
            <li>Include a "Favorites" tab, so users can quickly navigate to these restaurants</li>
            <li>Make prototype fully clickable</li>
            <li>Conduct further user testing with UCSD students</li>
          </ul>
