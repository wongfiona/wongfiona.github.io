        <div class="col-sm-8 column-text pad-right">
          <p>Elderly people who have medical needs often experience forgetting
            when and how often to take each of their prescribed medications. According
            to a <a class="blue underline" href="https://www.epill.com/statistics.html" target="_blank">2010 Med
              Ad News poll</a> with US individuals 65 years and older, 51% take at
            least 5 different prescription drugs regularly. 57% of those polled admit that
            they forget to take their medicine. Among those using 5 or more medications, 63%
            say they forget doses. Our team decided to design a web application with the elderly
            as our target audience. We wanted to help them alleviate this problem of forgetting
            to take their medicine and overall make their life easier.</p>
          <h4 class="subtitle">Key Challenges</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Elderly people are not familiar with mobile apps.</li>
              <li>Many apps require users to manually input detailed information about medicine.</li>
              <li>Elderly people tend to have vision problems, which can lead to difficulty to use mobile apps.</li>
            </ol>

        <div class="col-sm-8 column-text pad-right">
          <p>We brainstormed a couple of personas to think about the type of users
            who might use our app. We then created storyboards from these personas
            to generate some scenarios where our app could be used as a
            solution to their problems.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-8 column-text pad-right">
          <p>We brainstormed many ideas and sketched out a few prototypes. We decided to offer two
          interfaces: one for the <b>elderly</b> and one for the <b>caretakers</b> (family members, doctors).</p>
          <img class="center img-fluid medalarm-img" src="images/medalarm_imgs/prototype2.png" style="width: 500px">
          <img class="img-fluid float-right" src="images/medalarm_imgs/prototype.png" style="width: 300px">
          <p> Once you open the app, the user is greeted with two buttons: main user or caretaker.
            After selecting one of the two options and logging in, it will show two different screens
            based on which interface the user chose. The elderly people's would show a daily
            calendar with all their medicine reminders laid out in chronological order on their home
            screen. The caretaker's interface would show a list of contacts for who they're taking care
            of. Besides seeing all their medical information, they would also be able to add
            new medications for them.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-8 column-text pad-right">
          <p>After creating an interactive prototype, we conducted user testing with others
            in our class. We received feedback regarding the layout of the app as well as
            the user flow. We grouped and summarized all the feedback we received into a
            single document so we could easily see which places we need to fix.</p>
          <h4 class="subtitle">Features to Include:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Grouping the medicine on the home page into 3 time periods (morning,
                  afternoon, evening) as to not overwhelm the user with a list of medicine</li>
                <li>Implementing a QR code feature for users to easily input medicine information,
                  rather than having to type everything out</li>
                <li>Supporting font and color contrast adjustment to accommodate for vision problems</li>

          <img class="center img-fluid medalarm-img" src="images/medalarm_imgs/usertesting.png" style="width:500px">
          <p>After incorporating the user feedback we received, we designed the rest of our screens
            using Marvel and connected the user flow in a way that was clear. We made sure to include
            all the features mentioned above and decided on a soft and warm color scheme
            that would be easy on our user's eyes. We also provided help documentation and included
            a Q&A if users got stuck at any point. We made sure that each button was clickable and
            that there were confirmation messages for adding or deleting something. Check out our
            <a class="blue underline" href="https://marvelapp.com/4gbje43" target="_blank">interactive prototype</a>.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-8 column-text pad-right">
          <p>We compared our app design to others that have the same function as ours.
            We performed a competitive analysis to see what similar features they offered, as
            well as what features make our app unique.</p>

          <p>This table shows a comparison of our app design with other existing apps.
            We chose these factors to compare because these were the factors that
            we decided were the most important for our target audience, the elderly.
            The main point of these apps are to <b>keep track of medicine</b> and have a
            reminder function for appointments. However, <b>sound notifications and alarms</b>
            are crucial as our users might misplace their phones. <b>Multiple user support</b>
            is a good feature because as our users are of old age, they may be quite
            forgetful, so having a caretaker with access to their account can be very
            helpful. We designed our interface especially for the elderly, so we offer
            font size adjustment and higher contrast settings. We also added a QR code
            feature so users can <b>easily input their medicine</b> by simply taking a picture
            of the QR code, rather than typing out all the tedious information that comes
            with a bottle of medicine.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-8 column-text pad-right">
          <p>This project was the first I've worked on that targeted a specific audience
            that wasn't as accessible for us for interviewing and testing. We had to keep in
            mind about the accessibility of our app, such as color contrast and larger font size
            in order to make this app as easy to use as possible for the elderly.
            I would've liked to conduct user testing with the elderly and see if they
            encounter any problems with our prototype. Getting feedback from our target
            audience would've been very valuable to further develop our app.</p>
          <h4 class="subtitle">Next Steps</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Add photos of medicine</li>
            <li>Add voice input</li>
            <li>Add "Notes" feature</li>
            <li>Include feedback to confirm if users have taken the medicine</li>
            <li>Available in multiple languages, enable medicine translation function</li>
