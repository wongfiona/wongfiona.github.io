        </div>
        <div class="column-text">
          <p>Elderly people who have medical needs often experience forgetting
            when and how often to take each of their prescribed medications. According
            to a <a href="https://www.epill.com/statistics.html" target="_blank">2010 Med
              Ad News poll</a> with US individuals 65 years and older, 51% take at
            least 5 different prescription drugs regularly. 57% of those polled admit that
            they forget to take their medicine. Among those using 5 or more medications, 63%
            say they forget doses. Our team decided to design a web application with the elderly
            as our target audience. We wanted to help them alleviate this problem of forgetting
            to take their medicine and overall make their life easier.</p>
          <h4 class="subtitle">Key Challenges</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Elderly people are not familiar with mobile apps.</li>
              <li>Many apps require users to manually input detailed information about medicine.</li>
              <li>Elderly people tend to have vision problems, which can lead to difficulty to use mobile apps.</li>
            </ol>

          <h3 class="heading">Storyboarding</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="column-text">
          <p>We brainstormed a couple of personas to think about the type of users
            who might use our app. We then created storyboards from these personas
            to generate some scenarios where our app could be used as a
            solution to their problems.</p>

        <h3 class="heading">Prototyping</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="column-text">
        <p>We brainstormed many ideas and sketched out a few prototypes. We decided to offer two
        interfaces: one for the <b>elderly</b> and one for the <b>caretakers</b> (family members, doctors).</p>
        <img class="center medalarm-img" src="images/medalarm_imgs/prototype2.png" style="width: 500px">
        <img class="float-right" src="images/medalarm_imgs/prototype.png" style="width: 300px">
        <p> Once you open the app, the user is greeted with two buttons: main user or caretaker.
          After selecting one of the two options and logging in, it will show two different screens
          based on which interface the user chose. The elderly people's interface would show a daily
          calendar with all their medicine reminders laid out in chronological order on their home
          screen. The caretaker's interface would show a list of contacts for who they're taking care
          of. Besides seeing all their medical information, they would also be able to add
          new medications for them.</p>

        <h3 class="heading">User Testing</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="column-text">
        <p>After creating an interactive prototype, we conducted user testing with others
          in our class. We received feedback regarding the layout of the app as well as
          the user flow. We grouped and summarized all the feedback we received into a
          single document so we could easily see which places we need to fix.</p>
        <h4 class="subtitle">Features to Include:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Grouping the medicine on the home page into 3 time periods (morning,
                afternoon, evening) as to not overwhelm the user with a list of medicine</li>
              <li>Implementing a QR code feature for users to easily input medicine information,
                rather than having to type everything out</li>
              <li>Supporting font and color contrast adjustment to accommodate for vision problems</li>
            </ul>
        <img class="center medalarm-img" src="images/medalarm_imgs/usertesting.png" style="width:500px">
        <p>After incorporating the user feedback we received, we designed the rest of our screens
          using Marvel and connected the user flow in a way that was clear. We made sure to include
          all the features mentioned above and decided on a soft and warm color scheme
          that would be easy on our user's eyes. We also provided help documentation and included
          a Q&A if users got stuck at any point. We made sure that each button was clickable and
          that there were confirmation messages for adding or deleting something. A link to our
          interactive prototype can be found <a href="https://marvelapp.com/4gbje43" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <h3 class="heading">Competitive Analysis</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="column-text">
        <p>We compared our app design to others that have the same function as ours.
          We performed a competitive analysis to see what similar features they offered, as
          well as what features make our app unique.</p>
        <img class="subtitle" src="images/medalarm_imgs/competitor1.png" style="width:700px">
        <img class="subtitle" src="images/medalarm_imgs/competitor2.png" style="width:700px">
        <img class="medalarm-img" src="images/medalarm_imgs/chart.png" style="width:700px">
        <p>This table shows a comparison of our app design with other existing apps.
          We chose these factors to compare because these were the factors that
          we decided were the most important for our target audience, the elderly.
          The main point of these apps are to <b>keep track of medicine</b> and have a
          reminder function for appointments. However, <b>sound notifications and alarms</b>
          are crucial as our users might misplace their phones. <b>Multiple user support</b>
          is a good feature because as our users are of old age, they may be quite
          forgetful, so having a caretaker with access to their account can be very
          helpful. We designed our interface especially for the elderly, so we offer
          font size adjustment and higher contrast settings. We also added a QR code
          feature so users can <b>easily input their medicine</b> by simply taking a picture
          of the QR code, rather than typing out all the tedious information that comes
          with a bottle of medicine.
