          is an initiative based in Glen Ellyn, IL to actively celebrate and embrace diversity by raising awareness, acceptance, and involvement of neighbors of all backgrounds.
          In Winter 2021, I joined a volunteer organization called <a href="https://www.developforgood.org/" target="_blank">Develop for Good</a>, and partnered with One Community
          to redesign and develop their website in a team of 4 designers and 2 product managers.
          We met with our client every week to present our deliverables and consulted with them throughout the design process, ensuring we were on the same page and working towards the right direction.</p>

        <p>We first interviewed our client to get a better understanding of his
          <b class="santorini-bold">objectives, branding, and information about the restaurant</b>. We compiled a list of
          questions to ask him, such as what he would want users to learn about
          Santorini after visiting the website, his current frustrations with the website,
          and features he would want to be implemented.</p>
        <p>From his answers, we came up with a priority list for the redesign, which included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Aim to reflect their motto <em>"We Speak Fresh"</em> and emphasize freshness in their food</li>
          <li>An "About" page to highlight Santorini's history and Greek culture</li>
          <li>Easier to read menus with more pictures</li>
          <li>Have a business page for potential investors</li>
        </ul>
        and used the <b class="santorini-bold">MoSCoW method</b> to categorize them and see what features we should focus on

          We focused on the Santorini located at UCSD's Price Center because our client wanted
          to reach out and expand to other universities. So we interviewed people from the UCSD
          community to get more relevant data for his target audience of university students.
          Some questions we asked included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What are some factors you consider before choosing a place to eat?</li>
          <li>Why do you choose to eat at Santorini over other food places?</li>
          <li>What do you think about the quality of the food at Santorini?</li>
          <li>Tell me about a time you visited a restaurant website. Why did you visit it?</li>
          <li>Have you ever visited the Santorini website?</li>
            <ul><li>If yes, what are your impressions of it? If no, what would make you want to use it?</li></ul>

        <h3 class="heading">üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Testing our iterative designs</h3>
        <p>After we created a working prototype of our website, we <b class="santorini-bold">conducted usability testing with 9 participants</b>.
          Tasks included finding out what time a restaurant closes, finding the address,
          ordering online, finding where to buy sauces, ordering catering, and
          downloading the job application.<p>
        <p>We tested on mobile first, and then desktop.
          Some users struggled with a few of the tasks we had for them, making it clear what
          we needed to work on in order to improve their experience. After each usability test, we took the feedback we received into consideration
          and <b class="santorini-bold">iterated on our prototypes</b>, so each user saw a slightly new and improved version of our prototype.</p>

        <div class="pad-bottom">
          <h4 class="subtitle"><mark class="santorini-mark">Location Cards</mark></h4>
          <p>We explored the idea of adding tags in the location cards, but they were confusing for our users. We
            didn't think it was necessary to include them in our final design and removed them, focusing on the main infomation
            users thought were valuable and needed to see.</p>

          <p>We wanted to use dropdowns for Locations and Menus in the navigation, but ultimately decided to
          remove them on both mobile and desktop to make it consistent and easier to click for users.</p>

          <h4 class="subtitle"><mark class="santorini-mark">Footer</mark></h4>
          <p> Originally, we had every single page and the contact information in the footer. However,
            this overwhelmed the user with lots of information, so we decided to only focus on the information
            our users needed to access in the footer.</p>

        <h3 class="heading">ü§î Key Design Problems</h3>
        <p>We felt it was difficult when our client's requests conflicted with our user needs
          and user testing results. We needed to design in a way that would satisfy our client
          and be validated by our research and user data.</p>

        <div class="pad-bottom">
          <h4 class="subtitle"><mark class="santorini-mark">Navigation</mark></h4>
          <p> We struggled with how to separate the pages on our site and where to place them, so
            we decided on this navigation design to highlight pages that were most important to our users
            and fulfilled the request of our client.</p>
          <img class="img-fluid center" src="images/santorini-imgs/user-testing-nav-desktop.png" style="width:100%">
        </div>

        <!<h4 class="subtitle">Our Story</h4>
        <p>On the About page, we struggled to make it more visually appealing and convey the brand more.
          At first, we only included photos of Greece, but there wasn't much relation to the restaurant
          despite the timeline content being about the founding of the Santorini restaurant. Afterwards,
          we received more content from our client and included pictures of Greek food and fresh ingredients
          to reiterate on the motto, "We Speak Fresh!" We also added an additional section on "Benefits of a
          Mediterranean Diet".</p>

        <div class="pad-bottom">
          <h4 class="subtitle"><mark class="santorini-mark">Logo</mark></h4>
          <p>We used the current Santorini logo in our initial prototype. However, the logo looked <b class="santorini-bold">messy
            and cluttered</b>. Users were unable to read "Island Grill" in the logo (especially on a small screen on mobile devices).
            This is important since it's the name of the website.</p>
          <p>We decided to redesign the logo and make it cleaner by taking out
            the water in the old logo and straightening out the letters so it didn't overlap with other elements in the logo,
            making it easier for users to read. Overall, we made it look more <b class="santorini-bold">modern, while maintaining the color scheme
            and visuals to convey the brand</b>.</p>

        <p>We chose colors that use the Mediterranean blues, bright red, and white to reflect the Santorini brand.
          We wanted our redesign to represent the aesthetics of <b class="santorini-bold">Greek culture</b>,
          and be <b class="santorini-bold">eye-catching, colorful, and modern</b>.</p>

        <ol>
          <li><b class="santorini-bold">Don't be afraid to ask your client for what you need.</b>
            <p>It was difficult to get the content we needed from Santorini's president, but I learned that we just needed to be persistent and keep asking him.
              I also learned to check in frequently with our client, getting feedback early and often and being transparent about what you need is key.</p>
          </li>
          <li><b class="santorini-bold">Design for your users, not just your client.</b>
            <p>It was challenging to balance both client expectations as well as user needs, especially when they conflict with each other.
              The feedback we received from user testing was very valuable and helped us focus on what to improve on in our prototype iterations.</p>
          </li>

        <!<p>Working on this project with my team has been a really rewarding experience!
          It was challenging to balance both client expectations as well as user needs, especially
          when they conflict with each other. It was also difficult to get the content we needed from
          Santorini's president, but I learned we <b class="santorini-bold">shouldn't be afraid to ask for what we need</b> from our client.
          We also struggled to find the best way to visually present our information
          and convey the Santorini brand through our redesign. The feedback we received from
          user testing, our client, and our professor also helped us <b class="santorini-bold">focus on what to improve on</b> in our prototype iterations.

        <h3 class="heading">üå± Next Steps</h3>
        <p>This was a quarter long project that went remote in our last 2 weeks due to COVID-19.
          As we were adapting to the transition of suddenly coordinating work online, we did not have enough time to cover everything we wanted to.
          If we had more time, we would explore other potential features, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Implement a roll over feature on menu images to see them better</li>
          <li>Add a gallery to display larger images of the food</li>
          <li>Bringing our hi-fi prototype into development</li>
        </ul>
          The next steps would be to work with a developer to implement these functionalities on the live site.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Image carousel on the home page</b>
            <ul><li>On the actual website, the images would play automatically and
            users would be able to click on the arows to see the next image. The transition would be smooth. Figma
            can only support a horizontal scroll, so this is whow we implemented this on our design. Users would
            have to drag the image to see the next image on our Figma prototype.</li></ul>
          <li><b>Locations / Menus</b>
            <ul><li>These pages would show the closest location and highlight the operating hours
            of the current day in blue on the actual website. Our prototype assumes that the current location is UCSD's
            Santorini Island Grill, and that the current day is Wednesday.</li></ul>
          <li><b>Contact forms</b>
            <ul><li>In the actual website, users would be able to type in their information in the text
            fields. These fields would have input validation. Our current prototype doesn't allow for this kind of
            interactivity, so we mimicked this interaction by having a step by step completion. In our Figma prototype,
            if users click on the first field, then they can move on to the second field, and so on.</li></ul>
          <li><b>Downloading Job Application</b>
            <ul><li>In the actual website, a PDF of the job application would be downloaded
            onto the user's device. In our Figma prototype, the button is unable to prototype functionality. We added a
            confirmation screen after the PDF was supposedly downloaded to ensure that users understood what the functionality was.</li></ul>
