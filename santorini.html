        <p>
          <a href="http://santoriniislandgrill.net/" target="_blank">Santorini Island Grill</a>
          is a chain Greek restaurant with three locations in San Diego and one in
          Santa Barbara. For our quarter project for our Practicum in Web Design Course,
          we reached out to the president, Takis Vartelas, and
          offered to redesign the existing desktop and mobile website over the
          course of 10 weeks. Takis gladly accepted our offer as he also wanted a complete revamp of the current website.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Problem</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The current website was <b>outdated</b>, with inaccurate and
            incomplete information.</li>
          <li>The navigation was <b>confusing</b> and the menus were
            <b>difficult to read</b>.</li>
          <li>The overall website <b>did not attract customers</b> and <b>lacked
            a distinct brand and aesthetic appeal</b>.</li>

        <h3 class="heading">Interviewing our Client</h3>
        <p>We first interviewed our client to get a better understanding of his
          objectives, branding, and information about the restaurant. We compiled a list of
          questions to ask him, such as what he would want users to learn about
          Santorini after visiting the website, his current frustrations with the website,
          and features he would want to be implemented. From his answers,
          we came up with a
          <!--<a class="blue" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z2KqmmFZRxDnvYQKmfHCN4-boHKZBize/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">-->
          priority list
           for the redesign, which included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Aim to reflect their motto <em>"We Speak Fresh"</em> and emphasize freshness in their food</li>
          <li>An "About" page to highlight Santorini's history and Greek culture</li>
          <li>Easier to read menus with more pictures</li>
          <li>Have a business page for potential investors</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We used the MoSCoW method to separate our priorities and see what features we should focus on
          for the redesign.</p>

          user interviews
           with 9 participants from the UCSD community.
          We focused on the Santorini located at UCSD's Price Center because our client wanted
          to reach out and expand to other universities. So we interviewed people from the UCSD
          community to get more relevant data for his target audience of university students.
          Some questions we asked included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What are some factors you consider before choosing a place to eat?</li>
          <li>Why do you choose to eat at Santorini over other food places?</li>
          <li>What do you think about the quality of the food at Santorini?</li>
          <li>Tell me about a time you visited a restaurant website. Why did you visit it?</li>
          <li>Have you ever visited the Santorini website?</li>
            <ul><li>If yes, what are your impressions of it? If no, what would make you want to use it?</li></ul>

        <ol>
          <li>Most college students want <b>affordable</b> dining options and think about their expenses wisely.</li>
          <li>Some students are <b>busy</b> and want to grab lunch in between classes for a <b>quick bite</b>.</li>
          <li>Others specifically look for places that serve <b>fresh and healthy</b> options.</li>
          <li>Customers visit restaurant websites to mainly check the <b>hours, location, and menu</b>.</li>
          <li>Most customers have never visited the Santorini website and didn't even know they had one.</li>

          to communicate the freshness of the food and the Greek Islands' beautiful landscape.</p>

           detailing what the finished product will be, with a summary of what content goes into each page.
           We defined the key target audience, and stated clear, measurable objectives for both our client and the audience.</p>-->
        <h3 class="heading">Opportunities</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Communicate that Santorini provides <b>fresh, high quality food at a great price point</b>.</li>
          <li>Attract <b>younger people</b> with our design, since our primary audience is college students,

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Site Architecture</h3>

        <h3 class="heading">User Testing</h3>
        <p>After we created a working prototype of our website, we conducted user testing.
          Tasks included finding out what time a restaurant closes, finding the address,
          ordering online, finding where to buy sauces, ordering catering, and
          downloading the job application.<p>

        <p>We tested on mobile first, and then desktop.
          Some users struggled with a few of the tasks we had for them, making it clear what
          we needed to work on in order to improve their experience. After we received feedback
          from our users, we noted the points we needed to fix and change.</p>

        <h4 class="subtitle">Location Cards</h4>
        <p>We explored the idea of adding tags in the location cards, but they were confusing for our users. We
          didn't think it was necessary to include them in our final design and removed them, focusing on the main infomation
          users thought were valuable and needed to see.</p>
        <img class="img-fluid center" src="images/santorini-imgs/user-testing-location-cards.png" style="width:100%;">

        <h4 class="subtitle">Dropdown Navigation</h4>
        <p>We wanted to use dropdowns for Locations and Menus in the navigation, but ultimately decided to
        remove them on both mobile and desktop to make it consistent and easier to click for users.</p>
        <img class="img-fluid center" src="images/santorini-imgs/user-testing-nav-mobile.png" style="width:100%;">

        <h4 class="subtitle">Footer</h4>
        <p> Originally, we had every single page and the contact information in the footer. However,
          this overwhelmed the user with lots of information, so we decided to only focus on the information
          our users needed to access in the footer.</p>
        <img class="img-fluid center" src="images/santorini-imgs/user-testing-footer-mobile.png" style="width:100%;">
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Key Design Problems</h3>
        <p>We felt it was difficult when our client's requests conflicted with our user needs
          and user testing results. We needed to design in a way that would satisfy our client
          and be validated by our research and user data.</p>
        <h4 class="subtitle">Navigation</h4>
        <p> We struggled with how to separate the pages on our site and where to place them, so
          we decided on this navigation design to highlight pages that were most important to our users
          and fulfilled the request of our client.</p>
        <img class="img-fluid center" src="images/santorini-imgs/user-testing-nav-desktop.png" style="width:100%">

        <!--<h4 class="subtitle">Our Story</h4>
        <p>On the About page, we struggled to make it more visually appealing and convey the brand more.
          At first, we only included photos of Greece, but there wasn't much relation to the restaurant
          despite the timeline content being about the founding of the Santorini restaurant. Afterwards,
          we received more content from our client and included pictures of Greek food and fresh ingredients
          to reiterate on the motto, "We Speak Fresh!" We also added an additional section on "Benefits of a
          Mediterranean Diet".</p>
        <img class="img-fluid center" src="images/santorini-imgs/about.png" style="width:70%">-->

        <h4 class="subtitle">Logo</h4>
        <p>We used the current Santorini logo in our initial prototype. However, the logo looked <b>messy</b>
          and <b>cluttered</b>. Users were unable to read "Island Grill" in the logo (especially on a small screen on mobile devices).
          This is important since it's the name of the website.</p>
        <p>We decided to redesign the logo and make it cleaner by taking out
          the water in the old logo and straightening out the letters so it didn't overlap with other elements in the logo,
          making it easier for users to read. Overall, we made it look more <b>modern</b> while maintaining the <b>color scheme
          and visuals to convey the brand</b>.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Style Guide</h3>
        <p>We chose colors that use the Mediterranean blues, bright red, and white to reflect the Santorini brand.
          We wanted our redesign to represent the aesthetics of <b>Greek culture</b>,
          and be <b>eye-catching, colorful, and modern</b>.</p>

        <h3 class="heading">Takeaways</h3>
        <p>It was challenging to manage both client expectations as well as user needs, especially
          when they conflict with each other. It was difficult to get the content we needed from
          our client and we struggled to find the best way to visually present our information
          and convey the Santorini brand through our redesign. The feedback we received from
          user testing, our client, and our professor helped us focus on what to improve on.
          Working on this project with my team has been a really rewarding experience.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Next Steps</h3>
        <p>This was a quarter long project that went remote in our last 2 weeks due to COVID-19 precautions taken by our professors and TAs.
          As we were adapting to transitioning to working together online and preparing our final presentation to be over Zoom
          instead of in person as planned, we did not have enough time to cover everything we wanted to. If we did have more time, we would:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Include Catering in mobile hamburger menu as it is an important component for a restaurant</li>
          <li>Implement a roll over feature on menu images to see them better</li>
          <li>Add a gallery to display larger images of the food</li>
        </ul>
        <!--<p>Our prototype included a few functionalities that aren't fully interactive due to Figma's restrictions.
          The next steps would be to work with a developer to implement these functionalities on the live site.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Image carousel on the home page</b>
            <ul><li>On the actual website, the images would play automatically and
            users would be able to click on the arows to see the next image. The transition would be smooth. Figma
            can only support a horizontal scroll, so this is whow we implemented this on our design. Users would
            have to drag the image to see the next image on our Figma prototype.</li></ul>
          <li><b>Locations / Menus</b>
            <ul><li>These pages would show the closest location and highlight the operating hours
            of the current day in blue on the actual website. Our prototype assumes that the current location is UCSD's
            Santorini Island Grill, and that the current day is Wednesday.</li></ul>
          <li><b>Contact forms</b>
            <ul><li>In the actual website, users would be able to type in their information in the text
            fields. These fields would have input validation. Our current prototype doesn't allow for this kind of
            interactivity, so we mimicked this interaction by having a step by step completion. In our Figma prototype,
            if users click on the first field, then they can move on to the second field, and so on.</li></ul>
          <li><b>Downloading Job Application</b>
            <ul><li>In the actual website, a PDF of the job application would be downloaded
            onto the user's device. In our Figma prototype, the button is unable to prototype functionality. We added a
            confirmation screen after the PDF was supposedly downloaded to ensure that users understood what the functionality was.</li></ul>
