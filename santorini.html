            is a chain Greek restaurant with three locations in San Diego and one in
            Santa Barbara. We reached out to the president, Takis Vartelas, and
            offered to redesign the existing desktop and mobile website over the
            course of 10 weeks. Santorini aims to reflect their motto, <em>"We Speak Fresh"</em>,
            in their customer service and food options. Their branding implements
            aesthetics of <b>Greek culture</b>, and is <b>eye-catching, clean and modern</b>.</p>

          <p>We first interviewed our client to get a better understanding of their
            objectives, branding, and information about the restaurant. We compiled a list of
            questions to ask our client, such as what he would want users to learn about
            Santorini after visiting the website, his current frustrations with the website,
            and features he would want to be implemented. We interpreted his answers
            and came up with a priority list for the redesign, which included:</p>
          <ul class="spacing">
            <li>An "About" page to highlight Santorini's history and Greek culture</li>
            <li>Emphasize freshness in Santorini's food</li>
            <li>Easier to read menus with more pictures</li>

        <div class="col-sm-8 column-text pad-right">
          <p>Next, we conducted user interviews with 9 participants from the UCSD community.
            We focused on the Santorini located at UCSD's Price Center because our client wanted
            to reach out and expand to other universities, so we interviewed people from the UCSD
            community to get more relevant data for his target audience of university students.
            Some questions we asked included:</p>
          <ul class="spacing">
            <li>What are some factors you consider before choosing a place to eat?</li>
            <li>Why do you choose to eat at Santorini over other food places?</li>
            <li>What do you think about the quality of the food at Santorini?</li>
            <li>Tell me about a time you visited a restaurant website. Why did you visit it?</li>
            <li>Have you ever visited the Santorini website? If yes, what are your impressions of it? If no, what would make you want to use it?</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="subtitle">Personas</h4>
          <p>After conducting user interviews, we compiled the data into 3 distinct user types:
            <b>savers</b>, <b>busy-bodies</b>, and <b>health-conscious</b>.</p>

          <br><br>

          <p>From the interview data we gathered and trends we observed, we came up with specific
            user needs for each user type. We then created 6 user scenarios and 30 unique use cases that helped
            us establish a list of potential features and functionality for our redesign of Santorini's website.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-8 column-text pad-right">
          <p>We chose 5 of Santorini Island Grill's competitors:
            <a class="blue underline" target="_blank" href="https://littlegreekfreshgrill.com/">Little Greek Island Grill</a>,
            <a class="blue underline" target="_blank" href="https://thesimplegreek.com">The Simple Greek</a>,

            <a class="blue underline" target="_blank" href="https://tapiocaexpress.com/">Tapioca Express</a>.
            The first two restaurants were chosen because they are also Greek restaurants that serve the same type
            of food as Santorini. The last three were chosen based on proximity to the Santorini locations in San Diego.
            We analyzed both their mobile and desktop sites and put together a competitve analysis,
            separated into branding, functionality, site architecture, content, and overall good design ideas
            to inspire us for our redesign of Santorini's website.</p>

          <h4 class="subtitle">Summary of Findings</h4>
          <ul class="spacing">
            <li>Place emphasis on <b>slogan</b> to ensure that is the first thing that users see.</li>
            <li>Use <b>pictures of food</b> to attract customers. This also allows Santorini's fresh ingredients to shine through on their website.</li>
            <li>Keep it <b>consistent</b> and <b>simple</b> to avoid cluttering.</li>
            <li>Clearly label <b>opening times, closing times</b>, and <b>directions</b> for each store location.</li>
            <li><b>Embedded forms</b> simplify application processes for users to reach out to the company.</li>
            <li>Provide <b>clear indication</b> of which page the user is currently on.</li>
            <li>Highlight the business' <b>history to establish credibility</b> and tell their story.</li>
            <li><b>Organize menu items</b> in a clear manner so users can browse through items easier.</li>

        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-8 column-text pad-right">
          <p>After we created a working prototype of our website, we conducted user testing.
            Tasks included finding out what time a restaurant closes, finding the address,
            ordering online, finding where to buy sauces, ordering catering, and
            downloading the job application.
            Read more about our
              <a class="blue underline" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GlHg6MxTDP70U5ZrDKXSp9_YfWAByPzZ/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">user testing plan</a>.
            We tested on mobile first, and then desktop.
            Some users struggled with a few of the tasks we had for them, making it clear what
            we needed to work on in order to improve their experience. After we received feedback
            from our users, we noted the points we needed to fix and change.</p>
          <h4 class="subtitle">Location Cards</h4>
          <p> Users were confused about the tags in the location cards, thinking they were
              clickable links. To remedy this, we decided to remove the tags.</p>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="images/santorini_imgs/location-tag1.png" style="width:100%">
          <p class="subtitle"><em><b>Top:</b>Locations page on mobile. <b>Bottom:</b> Corresponding desktop page.</em></p>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="images/santorini_imgs/location-tag2.png" style="width:100%">

          <h4 class="subtitle">Dropdown Navigation</h4>
          <p> Users also experienced some trouble with the navigation, specifically the dropdown
            for Locations and Menus. On mobile, we had little arrows next to those two pages
            in the navigation. However, we only made the arrow lead to the dropdown, which was
            difficult for the user due to the small surface area. Clicking on the name of the page
            would lead them to the overview pages for Locations and Menus. We decided to remove the
            dropdown for these pages and only keep the links to the overview pages.</p>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="images/santorini_imgs/mobile-nav.png" style="width:100%">
          <p style="padding-top:30px">On desktop, dropdowns for each location would appear on hover over the Locations and Menus header.
            However, after user testing, we found out that users didn't know that they could click on those pages
            to get to an overview page with all the locations. They didn't know that page existed. We decided to
            remove the dropdowns on both mobile and desktop to make it less confusing for users.</p>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="images/santorini_imgs/desktop-nav.png" style="width:100%">

          <h4 class="subtitle">Footer</h4>
          <p> Originally, we had a three-column design with contact information in the footer. However,
            this overwhelmed the user with lots of information and looked cluttered. Users couldn't
            find the pages that weren't in the top navigation since we included every page in the footer.
            After user testing, we decided to highlight the social media links and keep only the 4 pages
            that weren't in the top navigation in the footer (Catering, Careers, Investors, and Contact).
            We also moved the contact information to the contact page to make the social media and navigation
            links stand out more.</p>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="images/santorini_imgs/desktop-footer.png" style="width:100%">
          <p class="subtitle"><em><b>Top:</b> Desktop footer. <b>Bottom:</b> Corresponding mobile footer.</em></p>

          <h3 class="heading">Key Design Problems</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-8 column-text pad-right">
          <p>We felt it was difficult when our client's requests conflicted with our user's needs
            and user testing results.</p>
          <h4 class="subtitle">Navigation</h4>
          <p> We were wondering what the best way was to separate the pages on our site. Our main
            personas wanted quick access to the Locations, Menus, and Investor pages. However, our
            client insisted that the investors and other contact pages should be hidden, so that
            only the people who were genuinely interested and scrolled through the website enough
            would reach out to him. We struggled with how to separate the pages and where to place
            them, so we settled on this navigation design to highlight pages that were most important.</p>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="images/santorini_imgs/navbar.png" style="width:100%">

          <h4 class="subtitle">Our Story</h4>
          <p>On the About page, we struggled to make it more visually appealing and convey the brand more.
            At first, we only included photos of Greece, but there wasn't much relation to the restaurant
            despite the timeline content being about the founding of the Santorini restaurant. Afterwards,
            we received more content from our client and included pictures of Greek food and fresh ingredients
            to reiterate on the motto, "We Speak Fresh!" We also added an additional section on "Benefits of a
            Mediterranean Diet".</p>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="images/santorini_imgs/about.png" style="width:100%">

          <h4 class="subtitle">Logo</h4>
          <p>We used the current Santorini logo in our initial prototype. However, the logo looked messy
            and cluttered. Users were unable to read "Island Grill" in the logo (especially on a small screen on mobile devices).
            This is important since it's the name of the website. We decided to redesign the logo and make it cleaner by taking out
            the water in the old logo and straigtening out the letters so it didn't overlap with other elements in the logo,
            making it legible for users to read. Overall, we made it look more modern while maintaining the color scheme
            and visuals to convey the brand.</p>

          <p>It was challenging to manage both client expectations as well as user needs, especially
            when they conflict with each other. It was difficult to get the content we needed from
            our client and we struggled to find the best way to visually present our information
            and convey the Santorini brand through our redesign. The feedback we received from
            user testing, our client, and our professor helped us focus on what to improve on.
            Working on this project with my team has been a really rewarding experience.</p>
          <h4 class="subtitle">Next Steps</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Include Catering in mobile hamburger menu as it is an important component for a restaurant</li>
            <li>Implement a roll over feature on menu images to see them better</li>
            <li>Add a gallery to display larger images of the food</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Our prototype included a few functionalities that aren't fully interactive due to Figma's restrictions.
            The next steps would be to work with a developer to implement these functionalities on the live site.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Image carousel on the home page</b>
              <ul><li>On the actual website, the images would play automatically and
              users would be able to click on the arows to see the next image. The transition would be smooth. Figma
              can only support a horizontal scroll, so this is whow we implemented this on our design. Users would
              have to drag the image to see the next image on our Figma prototype.</li></ul>
            <li><b>Locations / Menus</b>
              <ul><li>These pages would show the closest location and highlight the operating hours
              of the current day in blue on the actual website. Our prototype assumes that the current location is UCSD's
              Santorini Island Grill, and that the current day is Wednesday.</li></ul>
            <li><b>Contact forms</b>
              <ul><li>In the actual website, users would be able to type in their information in the text
              fields. These fields would have input validation. Our current prototype doesn't allow for this kind of
              interactivity, so we mimicked this interaction by having a step by step completion. In our Figma prototype,
              if users click on the first field, then they can move on to the second field, and so on.</li></ul>
            <li><b>Downloading Job Application</b>
              <ul><li>In the actual website, a PDF of the job application would be downloaded
              onto the user's device. In our Figma prototype, the button is unable to prototype functionality. We added a
              confirmation screen after the PDF was supposedly downloaded to ensure that users understood what the functionality was.</li></ul>
