        <p>
          This past summer, I participated in <a href="https://levelup.ucsddesign.co/" target="_blank">Design Co's Level Up</a> fellowship.
          Level Up is a 10-week design program that provides students with the opportunity to tackle a real-world challenge and network with experienced industry professionals.
          Participants worked in teams of four to produce a website showcase of project deliverables with the guidance of industry mentors.</p>

        <p>My team decided to focus on <b>Designing for Small Business Recovery</b>. We wanted to explore possible solutions
          to help small businesses recover due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
          as a way to give back to these services that have played a huge part of our daily lives.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Problem</h3>
        <h2 class="text-center center yelp-bold problem">How is COVID-19 affecting small businesses in the personal services industry?</h2>
        <p>As people are adjusting to the new norms of everyday life during the pandemic, a lot of small businesses in the
          personal services sector are struggling to make ends meet as they are seeing a <b>decline in their customers and as
          a result, their finances</b>. There’s a fair amount of uncertainty over COVID-19 for both the customers and workers of
          hair and nail salons, and it’s resulted in an <b>increasing sense of distrust on the customer side</b>, and an overall
          disconnect between the two.</p>
        <p>Before choosing a sector to focus on, we talked to several different business owners about the current obstacles they
          were facing, and some of our insights include a lot of general <b>uncertainty around the situation</b> and inability
            to plan as a result, <b>financial difficulty due to not having a backup plan</b>, and also difficulty in transitioning
            to an <b>online presence in order to communicate with their customers</b>.</p>
        <p class="yelp-quote text-center"><em><b>“It would be nice if there’s any way to announce our cleaning protocol is 100% in effect so we can rebuild some trust with our customers.”</em></b></p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Why Personal Services?</h3>
        <p>After conducting some initial background research, we decided to focus on the personal services sector for several reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>They're one of the top three industries most negatively affected by the pandemic</li>
          <li>They could benefit from an online presence</li>
          <li>No solutions immediately come to mind that are geared towards personal services — most are focused on the food & restaurant industry</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">User Research</h3>
        <p>We wanted to hear about what some of the real obstacles that small business owners are struggling with in their day to day since COVID-19 struck
          and were fortunate enough to be able to routinely talk to <b>4 small business owners</b> throughout the process. In addition, we sent out <b>surveys
          on social media platforms</b>, such as Reddit and Facebook, to really grasp the pain points on the consumer side.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Key Interview Findings</h3>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-6">
            <h4 class="subtitle yelp-bold">Small Businesses</h4>
            <p>In the realm of personal service businesses, many owners' ability to work and run their business has decreased. Their challenges include:</p>
            <ul class="pad-bottom">
              <li>Being uncertain when customers will return normally</li>
              <li>Unsure how to create / transition to an online presence in order to communicate with their customers</li>
              <li>Struggling financially with no backup survival plan</li>
              <li>Having to lay off employees in order to make ends meet</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-6">
            <h4 class="subtitle yelp-bold">Consumers</h4>
            <p>We wanted to learn about the users’ pain points, needs, and reasons why they are <b>not resuming use of personal care services</b>.
              After conducting Zoom interviews, the most popular responses were:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Fear over being indoors in public spaces</li>
              <li>Lack of safety regulation & uniformity across businesses</li>
              <li>Lack of knowledge with precautions taken by the workers </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Small businesses are taking one of the biggest hits from the pandemic. It was apparent that COVID-19 created a drift of disconnection between small businesses and their customers, leaving them both in a place of apprehension.</p>
        <p class="yelp-quote text-center"><em><b>“An online presence would really be helpful, but we don’t know where to start with that.”</em></b></p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Narrowing our Scope</h3>
        <p>After conducting user research, our main findings helped narrow down our problem statement. Consumers aren’t sure of how small businesses in personal services
          are taking precautions against COVID-19, while owners of small businesses have lack of experience and have put creating an online presence in the back burner
          of other COVID-19 obstacles.</p>
        <h2 class="text-center center yelp-bold problem">How might we bridge the distrust between customer and business through an online presence?</h2>
      </div>

      <!--<div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Opportunities</h3>
        <p>After synthesizing our user research and interview findings, we came up with 3 main opportunities to focus on.</p>
        <img class="img-fluid center pad-bottom" src="images/yelp-imgs/opportunities.png" style="width:80%;">
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Proposal</h3>
        <p>Instead of leaving small business owners in the unknown alongside their customers, we will add a useful and connecting feature on Yelp
          – booking appointments. That will help customers become more aware of the COVID-19 safety regulations and updates taken place by
          their hair and nail salon, which also includes booking appointments (at home or in store) all onto one platform. We also want to
          help businesses' increase cash flow by offering the purchase of gift cards directly on the Yelp app.</p>
      </div>-->

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Ideation + Early User Testing</h3>
        <p>Our initial idea was an in-app tutorial + discovery platform where customers can look for personal service businesses in their area  —  to be able to get information and book from there, and a place where owners can directly register their business (an online presence made easy).</p>
        <p>I sketched out low-fidelity paper prototypes and conducted user testing using Marvel. But through the first rounds of user testing, 75% of our users felt <b>limited</b> when using the app.
          They needed to <b>find more value</b> in the app and only understood part of the concept - locating businesses, instead of informing the public of small businesses in personal care and how they are adjusting to the new norm with their services.</p>
        <div class="row pad-bottom">
          <div class="col-sm-6">
            <img class="img-fluid center pad-bottom" src="images/yelp-imgs/paper-prototype.jpg" style="width:80%;">

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Since not a lot of users found this app valuable enough to download it in the app store, we knew we had to <b>reorient our direction</b>.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Building on Yelp</h3>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-7">
            <p>We chose to create new opportunities on Yelp because it has a high existing user base, with over 28 million downloads a month.
              <b>Already connecting people to their local businesses</b>, improving upon the interactiveness and communicative aspect of their existing
              appointment feature was something we saw great potential in.</p>
            <p>Yelp currently offers two options regarding appointments: requesting an appointment (similar to requesting a quote) and booking through
              a third party app (which isn't available to all businesses). Our redesign aims to allow users to <b>book appointments directly in the Yelp app</b> and offers a new option to <b>book At Home appointments</b>.</p>
            <p>In addition, we expanded on Yelp’s “<b>Deals & Offers” feature to better incorporate gift cards</b>, allowing users to purchase directly in-app.
              This is to help cash flow concerns due to less customers coming in for the duration of the pandemic.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">User Testing + Prototype Iterations</h3>
        <p>After we conducted user testing on our mid-fidelity prototype, we had to make some changes to improve our designs based on user feedback. We wanted to every iteration to be user driven.</p>

        <h4 class="subtitle">At Home Appointments</h4>
        <p>We wanted to present the information for At Home Appointments in a way that didn't overwhelm the user, but also adhered to Yelp's design system.</p>
        <img class="img-fluid center pad-bottom" src="images/yelp-imgs/user-testing-at-home.png" style="width:100%;">

        <h4 class="subtitle">Book an Appointment</h4>
        <p>We originally had a one page booking form, but after user testing, we decided to change it to a step by step booking process with less questions on each page.</p>
        <img class="img-fluid center pad-bottom" src="images/yelp-imgs/user-testing-booking.png" style="width:100%;">

        <h4 class="subtitle">View Appointments</h4>
        <p>We were thinking about where we should put the page to view and manage appointments. We conducted more research around our ideas and it helped us finalize our design decision.</p>
        <img class="img-fluid center pad-bottom" src="images/yelp-imgs/user-testing-view.png" style="width:100%;">

        <h4 class="subtitle">Gift Cards</h4>
        <p>We also wanted to add a way to buy gift cards onto the business page directly, instead of finding deals and offers in the More tab.</p>
        <img class="img-fluid center pad-bottom" src="images/yelp-imgs/user-testing-gift-cards.png" style="width:100%;">
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Style Guide</h3>
        <p>We adhered mainly to Yelp’s publicly released style guide since we wanted to incorporate our features seamlessly into the current app.
          Some changes we made included <b>cutting down on the additional shades of blues and greens</b>. Both were similar shades, with <b>no clear semantic
          differentiation</b> in how they’re currently used in the Yelp app.</p>
        <p>Instead we introduced teal as a primary color to <b>limit the color palette</b>,
          since we found those particular shades of green clashed visually with the Yelp red.
          Our visual designer also created <b>new illustrations</b> that matched Yelp's branding.</p>

          to industry professionals and the other Level Up participants at the final showcase, and walked them through our

          We were awarded <b>"Thoughtful Adoption Strategy"</b> for our thoughtful and seamless concept integration into Yelp
          that would be beneficial to both small business owners and Yelp.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Takeaways</h3>
        <!--<p>We had to pivot midway upon realizing our initial app idea wouldn’t work out. With our short timeline, that posed a significant challenge to us
          and we felt lost on what our next steps should be. We consulted our mentors who advised us to look through our user research and interview findings,
          letting that guide our direction.</p>-->
        <p>Since we were working on this project remotely, it was important to communicate clearly and effectively with everyone to make sure we're all on the same page.
          I asked everyone to participate in daily stand-ups on Slack by sending a quick message on what they've been working on, what they're planning on working on next, and if they had any blockers
          that anyone else on the team could help with. This helped us easily assess where everyone is at in the project and allowed us to work together efficiently across the distance.</p>
        <p>I worked closely with the other product designer on the team and bounced ideas back and forth. However, we didn't always agree or were indecisive about
          how to design something. I learned that it was easier to draft a quick mockup or prototype of our ideas and compare them visually as a way to help
          settle conflicts quickly.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Next Steps</h3>
        <p>If we had more time, we would explore more features we could potentially add to our prototype, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Include an indicator on the booking form to let users see their progress in completing the booking process</li>
          <li>Ideate more for Edit Appointment page to allow users to easily change their appointment</li>
          <li>Add employee shifts information to ensure customers can see they're spaced out from another</li>
        </ul>
