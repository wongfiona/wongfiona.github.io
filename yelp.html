          are struggling to make ends meet as they are seeing a <b class="yelp-bold">decline in their customers and as
          a result, their finances</b>. There‚Äôs a fair amount of uncertainty over COVID-19 for both the customers and workers of
          small businesses, and it‚Äôs resulted in an increasing sense of distrust on the customer side, and an overall
          disconnect between the two.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-6">
            <p>We wanted to hear about some of the real obstacles that small business owners are struggling with in their day to day since the pandemic started.
              We were able to interview and routinely talk to <b  class="yelp-bold">4 small business owners over Zoom</b>.</p>
            <p>They told us about their challenges and concerns over their ability to work and continue to run their businesses.</p>

        </div>

        <h4 class="subtitle"><mark class="yelp-mark">Consumers</mark></h4>
        <p>We also asked consumers why they are <b class="yelp-bold">not resuming use of personal care services</b> and posted surveys on social media platforms, such as Reddit and Facebook groups, to reach more users and grasp a better understanding of their pain points. These included:</p>
        <img class="img-fluid center pad-bottom" src="images/yelp-imgs/consumer-quotes.png" alt="Lack of safety regulations & uniformity across businesses, Fear over being indoors in public spaces, and Lack of knowledge with precautions taken by workers" style="width:80%;" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="300" data-aos-easing="ease-in-out" data-aos-anchor-placement="center-bottom" data-aos-once="true">
        <p>Small businesses are taking one of the biggest hits from the pandemic. It was apparent that COVID-19 created a rift of disconnection between small businesses and their customers, leaving them both in a place of apprehension.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">üîç Narrowing our Scope </h3>
        <p>After conducting user research, our main findings helped narrow down our problem statement. Consumers aren‚Äôt sure of how small businesses in personal services
          are taking precautions against COVID-19, while owners of small businesses have lack of experience and have put creating an online presence in the back burner
          of other COVID-19 obstacles.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Proposal</h3>
        <p>Instead of leaving small business owners in the unknown alongside their customers, we will add a useful and connecting feature on Yelp
          ‚Äì booking appointments. That will help customers become more aware of the COVID-19 safety regulations and updates taken place by
          their hair and nail salon, which also includes booking appointments (at home or in store) all onto one platform. We also want to
          help businesses' increase cash flow by offering the purchase of gift cards directly on the Yelp app.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">üí° Ideating & Concept Testing</h3>
        <p>Our initial idea was a <b class="yelp-bold">discovery platform & directory</b> where customers can look for nearby personal service businesses and be able to get information and book appointments from there.
          Small business owners could also directly register their business onto the platform - an online presence made easy.</p>

          They needed to <b class="yelp-bold">find more value in the app</b> and only understood part of the concept - locating businesses, instead of informing the public of small businesses in personal care and how they are adjusting to the new norm with their services.</p>

        <p>Since not a lot of users found this app valuable enough to download it in the app store, we knew we had to <b class="yelp-bold">reorient our direction</b>.</p>

        <p>After our 10 week sprint, we presented our <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12OTTLA8cfywDrcsLq1493tDzcRr7GCSW/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">slidedeck</a>
          to industry professionals and the other Level Up participants at the final showcase, and walked them through our
          <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/gPcXdZ4ZgbkjD3wGAqjUv5/Design-Co-Level-Up-Summer-2020?node-id=718%3A14472&viewport=584%2C359%2C0.08759123831987381&scaling=scale-down" target="_blank">final prototype</a>.
          We were awarded <b class="yelp-bold">"Thoughtful Adoption Strategy"</b> for our thoughtful and seamless concept integration into Yelp
          that would be beneficial to both small business owners and Yelp.</p>

        <h3 class="heading pad-bottom">üí≠ Takeaways</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><b class="yelp-bold">Learned the importance of staying open-minded as a designer.</b>
            <p>Even though our initial concept didn‚Äôt work out with users, we didn‚Äôt stay tied to that idea. We were open-minded and rethought it quite a bit. We pivoted midway through the project to come up with our solution to build on Yelp.</p>
          </li>
          <li><b class="yelp-bold">Don't reinvent the wheel.</b>
            <p>Users already had an existing solution that worked well for them (Yelp), so we decided not to build something from scratch. Instead, we found opportunities to expand on the app by streamlining the appointment booking process.</p>
          </li>
          <li><b class="yelp-bold">Learned how to recreate a design system and seamlessly integrate new features.</b>
            <p>Yelp had a public design system on their site, but it was really outdated since they recently updated and revamped their app. I recreated their design system with the current app's colors, typography, text hierarchy, button styles, and etc.,
              and I learned how to work within an existing complex design system to integrate new features.</p>
          </li>
          <!--<li><b class="yelp-bold">Communicate clearly and effectively to make sure everyone is on the same page.</b>
            <p>Since we were working on this project remotely, it was important that everyone knew what we were each working on and if there were any blockers anyone could help with.
            I asked everyone to participate in daily stand-ups on Slack, which helped us easily assess where everyone is at and allowed us to work together efficiently across the distance.</p>
          </li>
          <li><b class="yelp-bold">Draft quick prototypes to help settle design conflicts.</b>
            <p>I worked closely with the other product designer on the team and we constantly bounced ideas off each other. However, we didn't always agree about
              how to design something or were indecisive. I learned that it was easier to draft a quick mockup or prototype of our ideas and compare them visually as a way to finalize design decisions.</p>
          </li>-->
        </ol>
        <!--<p>We had to pivot midway upon realizing our initial app idea wouldn‚Äôt work out. With our short timeline, that posed a significant challenge to us
          and we felt lost on what our next steps should be. We consulted our mentors who advised us to look through our user research and interview findings,
          letting that guide our direction.</p>
        <p>Since we were working on this project remotely, it was important to <b class="yelp-bold">communicate clearly and effectively</b> with everyone to make sure we're all on the same page.
          I asked everyone to participate in daily stand-ups on Slack by sending a quick message on what they've been working on, what they're planning on working on next, and if they had any blockers
          that anyone else on the team could help with. This helped us easily assess where everyone is at in the project and allowed us to work together efficiently across the distance.</p>
        <p>I worked closely with the other product designer on the team and we constantly bounced ideas off each other back and forth. However, we didn't always agree about
          how to design something or were indecisive. I learned that it was easier to draft a quick mockup or prototype of our ideas and compare them visually as a way to <b class="yelp-bold">help

        <h3 class="heading">üå± Next Steps</h3>
        <p>If we had more time, we would explore more features we could potentially add to our prototype, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Include an indicator on the booking form to let users see their progress in completing the booking process</li>
          <li>Ideate more for Edit Appointment page to allow users to easily change their appointment</li>
          <li>Add employee shifts information to ensure customers can see they're spaced out from another</li>
          <li><b>Look more into the business owners' side on Yelp</b> -- we only had access to the consumer side, but I want to see how our designs would impact business owners and if it's feasible to implement from their end as well!</li>
