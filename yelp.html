        <h3 class="heading">Background</h3>
        <p>
          <a class="blue" href="http://santoriniislandgrill.net/" target="_blank">Santorini Island Grill</a>
          is a chain Greek restaurant with three locations in San Diego and one in
          Santa Barbara. For our quarter project for our Practicum in Web Design Course,
          we reached out to the president, Takis Vartelas, and
          offered to redesign the existing desktop and mobile website over the
          course of 10 weeks. Takis gladly accepted our offer as he also wanted a complete revamp of the current website.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Problem</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The current website was <b>outdated</b>, with inaccurate and
            incomplete information.</li>
          <li>The navigation was <b>confusing</b> and the menus were
            <b>difficult to read</b>.</li>
          <li>The overall website <b>did not attract customers</b> and <b>lacked
            a distinct brand and aesthetic appeal</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <img class="img-fluid center" src="images/santorini-imgs/old-new-home2.png" style="width:100%;">
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Interviewing our Client</h3>
        <p>We first interviewed our client to get a better understanding of his
          objectives, branding, and information about the restaurant. We compiled a list of
          questions to ask him, such as what he would want users to learn about
          Santorini after visiting the website, his current frustrations with the website,
          and features he would want to be implemented. From his answers,
          we came up with a
          <a class="blue" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z2KqmmFZRxDnvYQKmfHCN4-boHKZBize/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">priority list</a>
           for the redesign, which included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Aim to reflect their motto <em>"We Speak Fresh"</em> and emphasize freshness in their food</li>
          <li>An "About" page to highlight Santorini's history and Greek culture</li>
          <li>Easier to read menus with more pictures</li>
          <li>Have a business page for potential investors</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We used the MoSCoW method to separate our priorities and see what features we should focus on
          for the redesign.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Interviewing our Users</h3>
        <p>Next, we conducted
          <a class="blue underline" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IKBPZg-A7WpStIJrL8WmSUpSWmpQqcTH/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">user interviews</a>
           with 9 participants from the UCSD community.
          We focused on the Santorini located at UCSD's Price Center because our client wanted
          to reach out and expand to other universities. So we interviewed people from the UCSD
          community to get more relevant data for his target audience of university students.
          Some questions we asked included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What are some factors you consider before choosing a place to eat?</li>
          <li>Why do you choose to eat at Santorini over other food places?</li>
          <li>What do you think about the quality of the food at Santorini?</li>
          <li>Tell me about a time you visited a restaurant website. Why did you visit it?</li>
          <li>Have you ever visited the Santorini website?</li>
            <ul><li>If yes, what are your impressions of it? If no, what would make you want to use it?</li></ul>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Key Findings</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Most college students want affordable dining options and think about their expenses wisely.</li>
          <li>Some students are busy and want to grab lunch in between classes for a quick bite.</li>
          <li>Others specifically look for places that serve fresh and healthy options.</li>
          <li>Customers visit restaurant websites to mainly check the hours, location, and menu.</li>
          <li>Most customers have never visited the Santorini website and didn't even know they had one.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>From the

           we gathered and trends we observed, we compiled the data into 3 distinct user types:
          <b>savers</b>, <b>busy-bodies</b>, and <b>health-conscious</b>.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Taking a Look at Their Competitors</h3>
        <p>We chose 5 of Santorini Island Grill's competitors to analyze both their mobile and desktop sites and put together a
          <a class="blue" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y7iEYf81y2Oy-cb0OC11nzeWVrdmJuZo/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">
            competitive analysis</a>,
          separated into branding, functionality, site architecture, content, and overall good design ideas
          to inspire us for our redesign of Santorini's website.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Mood Boards</h3>
        <p>We also put together several mood boards that represent the theme, culture, color palette, and overall
          aesthetic of Santorini's website. We wanted to include colorful pictures of food and Santorini islands
          to communicate the freshness of the food and the Greek Islands' beautiful landscape.</p>
        <img class="img-fluid center" src="images/santorini-imgs/moodboards.png" style="width:100%;">
      </div>

    <h3 class="heading">Opportunities</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Communicate that Santorini provides <b>fresh, high quality food at a great price point</b>.</li>
          <li>Attract <b>younger people</b> with our design, since our primary audience is college students,
            and Santorini plans on expanding to more university locations.</li>
          <li>Make information about the restaurant <b>clear and easy to find</b>, so the audience knows that
            the website is <b>reliable</b>.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Site Architecture</h3>
        <p>Before we started to work on the design of each page, we created a site map, showing all navigation
          labels and the topology of how pages are connected.</p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="images/santorini-imgs/site-architecture.png" style="width:100%">
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Wireframes</h3>
        <p>We then sketched out low-fidelity wireframes of the mobile website
          to show the layout of each page, the navigation, and the footer.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">User Testing</h3>
        <p>After we created a working prototype of our website, we conducted user testing.
          Tasks included finding out what time a restaurant closes, finding the address,
          ordering online, finding where to buy sauces, ordering catering, and
          downloading the job application.<p>
        <p>We tested on mobile first, and then desktop.
          Some users struggled with a few of the tasks we had for them, making it clear what
          we needed to work on in order to improve their experience. After we received feedback
          from our users, we noted the points we needed to fix and change.</p>

        <h4 class="subtitle">Location Cards</h4>
        <p>We explored the idea of adding tags in the location cards, but they were confusing for our users. We
          didn't think it was necessary to include them in our final design and removed them, focusing on the main infomation
          users thought were valuable and needed to see.</p>
        <img class="img-fluid center" src="images/santorini-imgs/user-testing-location-cards.png" style="width:100%;">

        <h4 class="subtitle">Dropdown Navigation</h4>
        <p>We wanted to use dropdowns for Locations and Menus in the navigation, but ultimately decided to
        remove them on both mobile and desktop to make it consistent and easier to click for users.</p>
        <img class="img-fluid center" src="images/santorini-imgs/user-testing-nav-mobile.png" style="width:100%;">

        <h4 class="subtitle">Footer</h4>
        <p> Originally, we had every single page and the contact information in the footer. However,
          this overwhelmed the user with lots of information, so we decided to only focus on the information
          our users needed to access in the footer.</p>
        <img class="img-fluid center" src="images/santorini-imgs/user-testing-footer-mobile.png" style="width:100%;">
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Key Design Problems</h3>
        <p>We felt it was difficult when our client's requests conflicted with our user needs
          and user testing results. We needed to design in a way that would satisfy our client
          and be validated by our research and user data.</p>
        <h4 class="subtitle">Navigation</h4>
        <p> We struggled with how to separate the pages on our site and where to place them, so
          we decided on this navigation design to highlight pages that were most important to our users
          and fulfilled the request of our client.</p>
        <img class="img-fluid center" src="images/santorini-imgs/user-testing-nav-desktop.png" style="width:100%">


        <h4 class="subtitle">Logo</h4>
        <p>We used the current Santorini logo in our initial prototype. However, the logo looked <b>messy</b>
          and <b>cluttered</b>. Users were unable to read "Island Grill" in the logo (especially on a small screen on mobile devices).
          This is important since it's the name of the website.</p>
        <p>We decided to redesign the logo and make it cleaner by taking out
          the water in the old logo and straightening out the letters so it didn't overlap with other elements in the logo,
          making it easier for users to read. Overall, we made it look more <b>modern</b> while maintaining the <b>color scheme
          and visuals to convey the brand</b>.</p>
        <img class="img-fluid center" src="images/santorini-imgs/both-logos.png" style="width:70%;">
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 class="heading">Style Guide</h3>
        <p>We chose colors that use the Mediterranean blues, bright red, and white to reflect the Santorini brand.
          We wanted our redesign to represent the aesthetics of <b>Greek culture</b>,
          and be <b>eye-catching, colorful, and modern</b>.</p>

        <h3 class="heading">Takeaways</h3>
        <p>It was challenging to manage both client expectations as well as user needs, especially
          when they conflict with each other. It was difficult to get the content we needed from
          our client and we struggled to find the best way to visually present our information
          and convey the Santorini brand through our redesign. The feedback we received from
          user testing, our client, and our professor helped us focus on what to improve on.
          Working on this project with my team has been a really rewarding experience.</p>
        <h4 class="subtitle">Next Steps</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Include Catering in mobile hamburger menu as it is an important component for a restaurant</li>
          <li>Implement a roll over feature on menu images to see them better</li>
          <li>Add a gallery to display larger images of the food</li>
